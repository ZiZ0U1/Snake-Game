# 🐍 Snake Game

A classic console-based Snake game implementation. This project serves as a demonstration of basic game loop mechanics, collision detection, and dynamic data structures.

## ⚙️ Project Details

* **Language:** C++
* **Environment:** Console/Terminal
* **Key Concepts Demonstrated:**
    * Game Loop (`while(true)`)
    * Input Handling
    * Collision Detection (Self-collision and wall collision)
    * Dynamic movement and coordinate tracking

## 💡 OOP Structure (If Applicable)

[**Crucial Step:** If you used C++ and OOP here (e.g., a `Snake` class, a `Food` class, etc.), add the OOP table from the Ping Pong README above, tailoring the examples to this game. If it was purely procedural C, you can focus on the 'Key Concepts Demonstrated' list.]

## 🚀 How to Run the Game

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ZiZ0U1/Snake-Game.git
    cd Snake-Game
    ```

2.  **Compilation:**
    ```bash
    # If using g++ or a Makefile
    [Insert the actual commands you use to compile, e.g.: make or g++ -o snake main.cpp]
    ```

3.  **Execute:**
    ```bash
    ./snake
    ```
